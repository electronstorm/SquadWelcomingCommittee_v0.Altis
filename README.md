# SquadWecomingCommittee_v0.Altis

Please advise on where you are creating objectives for locations. Please ensure your objectives can be completed by 4-8 players with helo insertions. We are creating some other larger objectives like the one that I've done in this first set of tasks. This should create a stepping block where separate teams will have to begin to work together. 

Additionally, Zeus will be enabled on the mission to help keep objectives appropriate. Scripts should be limited. No cut scenes, and all global hints should be written with multiple missions happening at the same time in mind.

Tasks are created in scripts\initTasks.sqf

**Known issue:
Needs briefing.
